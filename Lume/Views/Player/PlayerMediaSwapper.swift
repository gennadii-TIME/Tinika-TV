//  The single path an in-player transport control takes to change stream. All
//  four engine hosts (KSPlayer, VLCKit, AVPlayer, LumeEngine) drove their own
//  near-identical copy of the tvOS channel swap; the on-screen previous/next
//  controls would have added two more. This is that logic, once.
//
//  It only ever *asks* for the swap: the target is handed back to the host
//  through `onSelectMedia`, which rebuilds the engine off a changed `media`.
//  Reaching into a running engine instead re-prepares a live session, which
//  frees the demuxer context under the decode threads.

/// inside the same window, which is the shape this guards against.
