//  CreditsInfo.swift
//  Lume
//
//  Canonical credits / licensing links, shared by the iOS Settings list
//  (tappable Link rows) and the tvOS About pane (read-only rows, since Apple TV
//  can't open a URL itself). One source of truth so the two surfaces — and the
//  licences they advertise — can never drift. Library names, licence names and
//  URLs are verbatim data; the surrounding descriptive copy is localised in the
//  views (the same split as SupportInfo).
//
//  Modified for Tinika TV: 2026-09-25 — attribute Lume (AGPL), LumeEngine (MIT)
//  and FFmpeg (LGPL) accurately; Tinika TV distribution source URL.
